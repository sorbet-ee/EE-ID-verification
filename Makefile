# Estonian ID Card Authentication - Development Makefile
# =====================================================
#
# This Makefile provides convenient development commands for the Estonian ID
# card authentication library. It handles dependency management, testing,
# building, and provides easy access to hardware testing with real cards.
#
# The library uses PKCS#11 interface to communicate with Estonian ID cards
# through OpenSC, providing secure authentication and personal data extraction.

# Declare all targets as phony to avoid conflicts with files of same names
.PHONY: help install test test_hardware run_local_card_test webeid_test build clean

# Default target - shows help when just running 'make'
